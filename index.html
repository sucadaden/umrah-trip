    <title>Upcoming umrah trip</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>I will make a page for my upcoming umrah trip</h1>

    <p>During the febaruary break I will be going on a family trip to Mecca and Medina to perform pilgrimage.</p>
    <p>It is a very exciting and fundamental trip for any muslim person.
        Muslim people all over the world save up for years to be able to perform pilgrimage and visit the holy land.
    </p>
    <p>There are two types of pilgrimages that can be done, a short one called Umrah and the longer one called Hajj. 
        Umrah pilgrimage can be performed at any time during the year and can be completed within a few days.
        Meanwhile Hajj can only be performed once a year during Ramadan and takes longer due to all the rituals and steps 
        needed to be performed. 
    </p>
     <p>Hajj is the major and greater pilgrimage as it is one of five pillars of Islam. It is obligatory upon all muslims to perform hajj once in their lifetime.
        Though only if they are capable financially and physically.
    </p>  
    <p>As I mentioned above there are five pillars of Islam that are the core values for any muslim person. I will list them down below.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Declaration of faith</li>
        <li>Obligatory prayers</li>
        <li>Giving to charity</li>
        <li>Fasting in Ramadan</li>
        <li>Pilgrimage to Mecca</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a picture I took from my last visit</p>
 

 
    <p>This will not be my first umrah trip but my second, but for the rest of my siblings it will be their first pilgrimage.
        I am excited to be their guide.
